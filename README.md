Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. Templating is done with Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This will add an entry to the database. The initial burger entry is added and placed on the left side of the screen.  Their is no limit to how many burgers a user may add.
The user may then click on a button (eat) of any burger, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status in the database.
